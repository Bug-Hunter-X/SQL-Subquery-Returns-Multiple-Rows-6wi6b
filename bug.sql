The SQL query uses a subquery that returns multiple rows when it should only return a single row.  This can lead to unexpected results or errors, depending on the database system.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name = 'Sales');
```

If the `departments` table has multiple rows with the name 'Sales', the subquery will return multiple `id` values, leading to an error in some database systems or unexpected behavior in others.
